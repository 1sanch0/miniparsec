# miniparsec

A small Parser Combinator from scratch in Python.

Heads up: I know nothing about parser combinators, I just read [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parser_combinator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parser_combinator) and went from there. So this is probably wrong lmao.

## Usage

```python
from miniparsec import *

# Define some parsers
```
